# chriselian-unit2-project

Unit 2 Project using a cloud data based application

Technologies used: express, node.js, css, html, javascript, mongo

My original approach for this project was to create an app that allows users to add/edit/remove mini plan post-its, as some sort of scheduler. I simply created the 7 crud routes for a basic app, and filled in the key pair values I thought were interesting. I want to come back to this project to add login functionality so that everybody isn't sharing a bunch of plans, as that would make no sense! Regardless, there were no unsolved problems.
